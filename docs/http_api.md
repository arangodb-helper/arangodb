# HTTP API 

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/arangodb-helper/arangodb/client?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/arangodb-helper/arangodb/client)

The starter exposes an HTTP(s) API that is used to query information of the starter cluster,
shutdown / remove starters etc.

Some part of the HTTP API is internal and is not supposed to be used by outside clients.

## Error handling

The following status codes are used.

  Clients should redirect their request, with the same HTTP method and payload, 
  to an URL found in the `Location` header.
- 400 Bad request. Used to indicate that some of the requests parameters are incorrect.
- 412 Precondition failed. Used to indicate that the requests parameters are correct,
  but the state of the system is such that the request cannot be executed at this time.
- 503 Service unavailable. Used to indicate that at this time the request cannot be 
  fullfilled. Clients are expected to retry after a short period.
